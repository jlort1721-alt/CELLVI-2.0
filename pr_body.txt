### Enterprise Infrastructure Upgrade

This PR implements the scaling strategy defined in docs/SCALING_STRATEGY.md and prepares the system for hyper-scale loads.

#### Database Optimizations
- **Spatial Indexing:** Added GIST index on geofences.geom for O(log N) geofencing lookups.
- **Hot Cache:** Created vehicle_last_positions table to serve live map data instantly without scanning historical telemetry.
- **Maintenance Performance:** Denormalized next_due_date column on maintenance_plans to speed up critical reports.

#### Documentation
- Added docs/SCALING_STRATEGY.md detailing partitioned tables and caching layers.
- Updates docs/AUDIT_REPORT_V2.md confirming security and performance improvements.

#### Validation
- **Local:** Migrations applied successfully via supabase db push.
- **Security:** RLS policies enforced on new cache tables.
- **Schema Drift:** Resolved next_due_date column missing issue with a robust backfill migration.
